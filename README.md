# dashboard_project

The objective of this project is to visualize data our group pulled from LendingClub. After cleaning the data in Python, we have the total amount funded to customers by Lending Club in each state, the average annual income of these customers, as well as their average credit scores.

I aim to create a visual using a map choropleth of the United States. By hovering over each state, a popup will detail the above information.

In addition, we were also able to deduce what percentage of these customers rent, pay a mortgage, or own their home outright. I originally wanted to create a pie chart that would also pop out when you hover above a state to show these percentages, but to do 50 pie charts may not be feasible in the amount of time given for this project.
